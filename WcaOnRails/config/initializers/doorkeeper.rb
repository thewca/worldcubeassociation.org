  # Change the native redirect uri for client apps
  # When clients register with the following redirect uri, they won't be redirected to any server and the authorization code will be displayed within the provider

  # Forces the usage of the HTTPS protocol in non-native redirect uris (enabled
  # by default in non-development environments). OAuth2 delegates security in
  # communication to the HTTPS protocol so it is wise to keep this enabled.

  # Specify what grant flows are enabled in array of Strings. The valid
  # strings and the flows they enable are:
  #
  # "authorization_code" => Authorization Code Grant Flow
  # "implicit"           => Implicit Grant Flow
  # "password"           => Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Flow
  # "client_credentials" => Client Credentials Grant Flow
  #
  # If not specified, Doorkeeper enables authorization_code and
  # client_credentials.
  #
  # implicit and password grant flows have risks that you should understand
  # before enabling:
