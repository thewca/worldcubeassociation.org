# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    who_we_are_title: Who we are
    who_we_are_content_html: <p>The World Cube Association governs competitions for mechanical puzzles that are operated by twisting groups of pieces, commonly known as 'twisty puzzles'. The most famous of these puzzles is the Rubik's Cube, invented by professor Rubik from Hungary. A selection of these puzzles are chosen as official events of the WCA.</p>
      <p>As the WCA has evolved over the past decade, over 100,000 people have competed in our competitions. Despite this growth, we remain an organization that is entirely run by volunteers, from local organizers to WCA Delegates to even the WCA Board. We are very grateful to everyone who takes time out of their lives to allow the WCA to function. With more financial support, we hope to bring an even greater level of professionalism to our competitions as we continue to sanction more events across the globe.</p>
    spirit: Our spirit is that people from all over the world have fun together in a friendly atmosphere, help each other and behave sportsmanlike.

    paragraph1:
      title: "How to organize a competition"
      content: "All WCA competitions must be attended and overseen by a WCA Delegate. If you are interested in organizing your own competition, please contact your nearest WCA Delegate. They will be able to give you more information on the local practices and can
      help you with finding a suitable date as they know if there are any other competitions planned in the same time frame. If there is no WCA Delegate near your area, please get in touch with the Senior Delegate for your region."
    paragraph2:
      title: "Expected expenses for organizing a competition"
      content: "The expected expenses differ greatly from country to country and are determined by several factors like the size of the venue and other general conditions. Recouping all expenses with registration fees is possible. However, to keep these as low as possible,
      it is highly recommended to search for sponsors. Although WCA Delegates are volunteers and do not receive a salary for their work, organizers should consider paying compensation for their travel expenses."
    paragraph3:
      title: "Deadlines for the announcement of the competition"
      content_html: "The competition must be announced at least 28 days before the start of the competition (see <a href='https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf'>Competition Requirements</a>)."
    paragraph4:
      title: "Proximity policy"
      content1: "WCA competitions will be accepted if they are at least 100 km or 19 days away from any other competition. The WCAT should particularly review a proposed competition if there is another competition for which the distance between them is less than 100 km and the time between them is less than 19 days. A Delegate requesting approval for such a competition must provide further information on why the competition should still be accepted. Possible arguments that support such a competition being accepted include:"
      olist1:
        '1': "The two competitions don't have events in common."
        '2': "The two competitions take place in different countries."
        '3': "In the last 12 months, there have been fewer than 16 competitions in the area 100 km around the competition."
      content2: '"3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions" are WCA competitions having only the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves event and taking place simultaneously in different locations.'
      olist2:
        '1':
          content1: "3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions cannot be part of any other regular competition."
          alist1:
            '1a': "Time frames when both are celebrated can’t overlap."
        '2':
          content1: "If any location of such competitions is closer than 100 km to any other regular competition, then"
          alist1:
            '2a': "both competitions should be at least 5 days apart, or"
            '2b': "the other competition must not have the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves event."
    paragraph-events:
      title: "Announcing events"
      content: 'All events that are going to be held at the competition must be specified by the Delegate when requesting the competition approval. Further additions must be approved by the WCAT.'
    paragraph5:
      title: "Competitor limits"
      content_html: "The number of competitors may be limited per event or per competition (see <a href='https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf'>Competition Requirements</a>). The Delegate of the competition must get an approval of the competitor limit by the WCAT. Competitor limits should be
        chosen wisely and in accordance with the expected competitor interest. The limit should not set to a lower number for minor reasons. The intended limit should already be taken into consideration when searching for a suitable venue. The competitors
        limit must be clearly stated on the competition page on the WCA website."
    paragraph6:
      title: "Handling registrations"
      content: "Registrations must be processed on a first come first served basis, which means that the earliest complete registration must be treated first. If registration fees are prepaid, a registration is considered complete when the registration fee has been paid. This
      should be clearly stated in the paying instructions on the competition website."
    paragraph7:
      title: "Managing the waiting list"
      content1: "Once the competitor limit for a competition is reached, a waiting list should be opened. When registered and approved competitors cancel their registration, they can be replaced with the next competitors on the waiting list."
      content2: "If competition registration fees are prepaid, it is an efficient approach to offer the free spot to the next competitor on the waiting list and set a deadline until when the registration fee should be paid to complete the registration (e.g. 48 hours). In case the payment is not
      received in time or the competitor denies, the free spot should be offered to the next person on the waiting list. This process should be continued until the free spots are filled. There are no exceptions for competitors to bypass the waiting list."
      content3: "If competitors did not go through the regular registration process but competed, their results will be removed retroactively (assuming the competitors limit existed and was reached)."
    paragraph8:
      title: "Tasks before the competition"
      list:
        '1': "Before announcing the competition, a schedule is required to be published on the competition website. This schedule can be adjusted later."
        '2': "Competitors should be split into groups, score sheets must be printed and should be split according to the groups' distribution. It is also recommended to plan who will scramble for every group of every event, at least for the first rounds.
        Scramblers should be reliable."
    paragraph9:
      title: "Tasks during the competition"
      content: "The tasks an organizer has to do during a competition should be discussed with the WCA Delegate. The typical tasks are (they can be delegated to other reliable people):"
