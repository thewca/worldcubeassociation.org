# Split context in several files.
#
# By default only one file with all translations is exported and
# no configuration is required. Your settings for asset pipeline
# are automatically recognized.
#
# If you want to split translations into several files or specify
# locale contexts that will be exported, just use this file to do
# so.
#
# For more informations about the export options with this file, please
# refer to the README
#
#
# If you're going to use the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline, change
# the following configuration to something like this:
#
# translations:
#   - file: "app/assets/javascripts/i18n/translations.js"
#
# If you're running an old version, you can use something
# like this:
#
# translations:
#   - file: "app/assets/javascripts/i18n/translations.js"
#     only: "*"
#
export_i18n_js: false
sort_translations_keys: true
# We set this programatically.
# Setting this here generates unecessary large files (such as the default
# English locale having default values for *all* available locales).
fallbacks: false
# This sets which keys we export from the locale file!
# It will need to be updated as we port more and more stuff to React.
