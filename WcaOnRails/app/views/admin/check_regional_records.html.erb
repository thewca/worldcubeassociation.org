    <p>
      This computes regional record markers for all successful results (value>0). If a result has a stored or computed
      regional record marker, it is displayed. If the two markers differ, they're shown in red/green.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only strictly previous competitions (other.<b>end</b>Date < this.<b>start</b>Date) are used to compare, not
      overlapping competitions. Thus I might wrongfully compute a too good record status (because a result was actually
      beaten earlier in an overlapping competition) but I should never wrongfully compute a too bad record status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the same competition, results are sorted first by round, then by value, and then they're declared records
      on a first-come-first-served basis. This results in the records-are-updated-at-the-end-of-each-round rule you
      requested.
    </p>

    <p>
      A result does not need to beat another to get a certain record status, equaling is good enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you choose 'All' both for event and competition, I only show the differences (otherwise the page would be
      huge).
