    <div>
      <p>In this script, a "person" always means a triple of (id,name,countryId) and "similar" always means just name
        similarity. A person is called "finished" if it has a non-empty personId. A "semi-id" is the id without the
        running number at the end.</p>

      <p>For each unfinished person in the Results table, I show you the few most similar persons. Then you make choices
        and click "update" at the bottom of the page to show and execute your choices. You can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Choose the person as "new", optionally modifying name, country and semi-id. This will add the person to the
            Persons table (with appropriately extended id) and change its Results accordingly. If this person has both
            roman and local names, the syntax for the names to be inserted correctly is 'romanName (localName)'.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Choose another person. This will overwrite the person's (id,name,countryId) triple in the Results table
            with those of the other person.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Skip it if you're not sure yet.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
