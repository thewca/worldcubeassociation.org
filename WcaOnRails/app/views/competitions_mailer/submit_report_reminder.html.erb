  Dear <%= "Delegate".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> of <%= @competition.name %>,
</p>

<p>
  This is an automated reminder. <%= @competition.name %> took place <%= (DateTime.now.utc.to_date - @competition.end_date).to_i %> days ago and
  the Delegate report must have been submitted
  within one week of the end of the competition according to the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf">WCA Competition Requirements Policy</a>. If you expect that you wonâ€™t be able to submit the report before the one week period (in UTC) ends, please reply to this email to update and explain this to your Senior Delegate. The report can be submitted <%= link_to("here", delegate_report_url(@competition)) %>.
</p>

<p>
  @Senior Delegate: You can view the <%= "history".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> of the <%= "Delegate".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> here:
  <ul>
    <% @competition.delegates.each do |delegate| %>
      <li><%= link_to "#{delegate.name}", competitions_url(display: "admin", years: "all", delegate: delegate.id), target: "_blank" %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
