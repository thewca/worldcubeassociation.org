  NOTE: Our headless browser PhantomJS doesn't support HTMLVideoElement.
  Leaflet has a built-in video plugin and its code do an "instanceOf(HTMLVideoElement)",
  which throws an error during tests.
  For this reason, we only import stuff from Leaflet if we are not in test environment.
  In test environment we just create a dummy VenueLocationInput.

<% if Rails.env.test? %>

  import { VenueLocationInputImpl } from './VenueLocationInputImpl.jsx'
  export const VenueLocationInput = (props) => (<VenueLocationInputImpl {...props} />);
