// This file is very awkward.
// Because we have two parallel pipelines to handle our js assets
// (rails sprockets and webpacker), we have dependencies issues.
// Both need lodash, but we need to put it in webpack dependencies,
// and webpack's application pack needs to be included after the sprockets one
// (because it has jquery...).
// Therefore we have a few helper here, until we port everything to webpacker.
