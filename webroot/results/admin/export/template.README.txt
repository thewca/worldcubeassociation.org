Description:
  This file contains public information on all official WCA competitions,
  WCA members and WCA competition results.

Goal:
  Goal of this file is for members of our community to do analysis on the
  information for statistical and personal purposes.

Allowed use: Information and parts of it may be published online,
but only under the following conditions:
  - A clearly visible link to World Cube Association website is added
    (http://www.worldcubeassociation.org) with the notification that
    World Cube Association is the source and owner of the information.
  - A clearly visible notification is added that the published information
    is not actual information.
  - A clearly visible link to http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results is
    added with the notification that the actual information can be found via
    that link.
  - A clearly visible notification which date is taken for the source of the data.
  - The style and format of the information must be clearly distinguishable
    from the official WCA website

The export consists of these tables:
  Persons        WCA competitors
  Competitions   WCA competitions
  Events         WCA events (Rubik's Cube, Megaminx, etc)
  Results        WCA results per competition+event+round+person
  RanksSingle    Best single result per competitor+event and ranks
  RanksAverage   Best average result per competitor+event and ranks
  Rounds         The round types (first, final, etc)
  Formats        The round formats (best of 3, average of 5, etc)
  Countries      Countries
  Continents     Continents
  Scrambles      Scrambles

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but several things merit further
explanation.

Countries stored include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist.  The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them.  Custom codes may used in some
circumstances.

Result values of the Results table can be interpreted as follows:
- The result values are in fields value1-value5, best and average.
- Value -1 means DNF
- Value -2 means DNS
- Value 0 means "nothing", for example a best-of-3 has value4=value5=average=0
- Positive values depend on the event, see column "format" in Events.
  - Most events have format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - Format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used
    by "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - Format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding not only the time
    but also the number of attempted and solved cubes. Writing the value in
    decimal it is interpreted ("decoded") using the following method:
      old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
      new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed
    In order to encode data, the following procedure should be followed:
             solved    = # cubes solved
             attempted = # cubes attempted
             missed    = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD        = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT     = solve time in seconds
             MM        = missed
    Note that this is designed so that a smaller value means a better result.
    This format does not allow for more than 99 attempted cubes, or for times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).
