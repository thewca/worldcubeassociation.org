<p>
  Dear <%= "Delegate".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> of <%= @competition.name %>,
</p>

<p>
  This is an automated reminder. Over a week has passed since <%= @competition.name %> took
  place and the results of the competition are still not available as required by the <a href="https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf">WCA Competition Requirements Policy</a>.
  There might be valid reasons for this, but nonetheless you are requested to reply to this mail
  to inform the results team about the state of the competition results, and reason for the
  delay, as soon as possible (if not already done).
</p>

<p>
  You can submit results <%= link_to "here", competition_submit_results_edit_url(@competition.id) %>.
</p>

<p>
  @Senior Delegate: You can view the <%= "history".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> of the <%= "Delegate".pluralize(@competition.delegates.count) %> here:
  <ul>
    <% @competition.delegates.each do |delegate| %>
      <li><%= link_to "#{delegate.name}", competitions_url(display: "admin", years: "all", delegate: delegate.id), target: "_blank" %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Regards,
  The WCA Results Team.
