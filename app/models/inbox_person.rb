    #   When calling `my_inbox_person.id` on the Rails model, you will receive an array
    #   as the return value, because of the `self.primary_key` override at the top of the file.
    # In some contexts, we do want to access the raw ID however
    #   (most notably, in validators when comparing for equality)
    # Note also, that doing `self[:id]` is not the same as `self.id`!
    #   - The latter gives the Rails "smart-cast" composite ID (as an array in this case)
    #   - The former gives the _attribute_ called `id` directly from the raw database record
