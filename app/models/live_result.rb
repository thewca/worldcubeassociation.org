    # The following query uses an `ORDER BY best <= 0, best ASC` trick. The idea is:
    #   1. The first part of the `ORDER BY` evaluates to a boolean. Booleans are just
    #     `TINYINT` in MySQL with TRUE=1 and FALSE=0, so that FALSE < TRUE.
    #     This means that valid attempts where `best <= 0` is FALSE come first, and
    #     invalid attempts where `best <= 0` is TRUE come last.
    #   2. The attempts are then sorted among themselves using their normal numeric value.
    #     This works in particular because sorting in MySQL is stable, i.e. the sorting
    #     based on the second part won't destroy the order established by the first part.
