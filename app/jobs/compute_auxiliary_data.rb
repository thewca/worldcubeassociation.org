  ######
  # WARNING: Shameless copy-paste ahead!
  #
  # These queries originate from results_controller.rb. The cleanest solution would be to provide a method
  #   which -- given an event ID, a region, a gender, etc. -- returns the SQL query string to the caller.
  #   Both the controller as well as this job could then use that method.
  # However, coming up with that method would require significant refactoring because of how all the
  #   SQL `AND` conditions are currently glued together in different formats and different places,
  #   and because of how deeply intertwined the query build process is with the `@var` global variables in the controller.
  # Since we're only ever using the `event_id` filter here, and all other filters that the results_controller supports
  #   are obsolete for this job, we would end up with an overblown solution that isn't really used except in one
  #   place to its full potential (and here in a very, very trimmed-down version).
  # So this shameless copy-pasta is the most time-efficient way I could come up with (and the next time we need to
  #   touch these queries we will most likely redesign the schema so fundamentally that we can get rid of the current
  #   caching approach anyways, so maintenance is at a minimum here.)
