<li id="9b3b+"><a href="#9b3b+">9b3b+</a>) <span class="CLARIFICATION label linked"><a href="./#9b3b">CLARIFICATION</a></span> The &quot;Mean of 3&quot; statistic does not affect the competitor's ranking in a &quot;Best of 3&quot; round (which is based on the best result).

<li id="A1a2+"><a href="#A1a2+">A1a2+</a>) <span class="ADDITION label linked"><a href="./#A1a2">ADDITION</a></span> In case of a cumulative time limit, the judge records the original recorded time for a DNF on the score sheet in parentheses, e.g. &quot;DNF (1:02.27)&quot;.</li>
<li id="A1a3+"><a href="#A1a3+">A1a3+</a>) <span class="REMINDER label linked"><a href="./#A1a3">REMINDER</a></span> The organisation team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two attempts in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a combined round), and that changing time limits after the beginning of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.</li>
<li id="A1a4+"><a href="#A1a4+">A1a4+</a>) <span class="REMINDER label linked"><a href="./#A1a4">REMINDER</a></span> If a competitor has accidentally been permitted to exceed the time limit, the time limit must be enforced retroactively, and the judge, competitor, and WCA Delegate should be informed (see <a href="./#1g2">Regulation 1g2</a>).

<li id="A7c+"><a href="#A7c+">A7c+</a>) <span class="ADDITION label linked"><a href="./#A7c">ADDITION</a></span> If a result signed by a competitor is found to be incomplete or unreadable, it should be interpreted the worst reasonable way (e.g. &quot;1:05&quot; will be considered 1:05.99, &quot;25.X3&quot; will be considered 25.73 if X could be either a 1 or a 7). Given that the Stackmat timer displays a time of X:0Y.ss as X:Y.ss, a missing tens digit should be considered more likely than a missing ones digit (e.g. &quot;1:2.27&quot; will be considered 1:02.27).
