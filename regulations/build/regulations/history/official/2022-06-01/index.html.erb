<li id="9f"><a href="#9f">9f</a>) The results of a round are measured as follows:
<ul>
<li id="9f1"><a href="#9f1">9f1</a>) All timed results under 10 minutes, except for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, are measured and truncated to the nearest hundredth of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.</li>
<li id="9f2"><a href="#9f2">9f2</a>) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes, as well as all times for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind results, are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. x.49 becomes x, x.50 becomes x+1).</li>
<li id="9f4"><a href="#9f4">9f4</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.</li>
<li id="9f5"><a href="#9f5">9f5</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.</li>
<li id="9f6"><a href="#9f6">9f6</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f7"><a href="#9f7">9f7</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.</li>
<li id="9f8"><a href="#9f8">9f8</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f9"><a href="#9f9">9f9</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, their average result for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f10"><a href="#9f10">9f10</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f11"><a href="#9f11">9f11</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, their average result for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f12"><a href="#9f12">9f12</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
<ul>
<li id="9f12a"><a href="#9f12a">9f12a</a>) For timed results, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f12b"><a href="#9f12b">9f12b</a>) For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter solution length.</li>
<li id="9f12c"><a href="#9f12c">9f12c</a>) For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, or if only 1 puzzle is solved, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9f13"><a href="#9f13">9f13</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where &quot;better&quot; is the smaller recorded result.</li>
<li id="9f14"><a href="#9f14">9f14</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where &quot;better&quot; is defined as the smaller recorded result.</li>
<li id="9f15"><a href="#9f15">9f15</a>) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9g"><a href="#9g">9g</a>) A Cutoff Round is a round with a &quot;Best of X&quot; cutoff phase and a cutoff requirement (e.g. &quot;Best of 2&quot; with a cutoff requirement of strictly better than 2 minutes). If the competitor satisfies the cutoff requirement in at least one of their cutoff phase attempts, they are eligible for the remaining attempts. Attempts from the cutoff phase count towards the full round format.</li>
<li id="9i"><a href="#9i">9i</a>) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
<ul>
<li id="9i1"><a href="#9i1">9i1</a>) The WCA recognizes the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.</li>
<li id="9i2"><a href="#9i2">9i2</a>) All the results of a round are considered to take place on the last calendar date of the round. If a regional record is broken multiple times on the same calendar date, only the best result is recognized as breaking that regional record.</li>

<li id="9p1"><a href="#9p1">9p1</a>) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.</li>
<li id="9p2"><a href="#9p2">9p2</a>) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by ranking (best x competitors) or by result (all competitors with a better result than x) in the preceding round.
<ul>
<li id="9p2a"><a href="#9p2a">9p2a</a>) For each round, advancement conditions must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9p3"><a href="#9p3">9p3</a>) If a qualifying competitor withdraws from a round, they may be replaced by the best-ranked non-qualifying competitor from the preceding round.</li>

<li id="11e"><a href="#11e">11e</a>) If an incident occurs during an attempt, the WCA Delegate may grant a competitor an extra attempt, replacing the attempt during which the incident occurred. The competitor must appeal verbally or in writing to the judge and WCA Delegate at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
<ul>
<li id="11e1"><a href="#11e1">11e1</a>) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence.

<ul>
<li id="A1"><a href="#A1">A1</a>) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedures.
<ul>
<li id="A1a"><a href="#A1a">A1a</a>) The organization team must apply exactly one kind of time limit (time limit per attempt or cumulative time limit) to each round.
<ul>
<li id="A1a1"><a href="#A1a1">A1a1</a>) The default time limit is 10 minutes for each attempt in a round, though the organization team may announce a higher or lower time limit per attempt. In this case, the limit must be the same for all attempts in a round.</li>
<li id="A1a2"><a href="#A1a2">A1a2</a>) For events other than 3x3x3 Fewest Moves and 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, the organization team may define a cumulative time limit. The cumulative time limit must either apply to all attempts in one round (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes), or to all attempts in a combination of rounds for different events. In this case, the time limit for a particular attempt is the cumulative time limit minus the total time in other attempts counting towards the time limit so far (see <a href="./#A1a5">Regulation A1a5</a>). If a round has an applicable cumulative time limit, it must have at most one.</li>
<li id="A1a3"><a href="#A1a3">A1a3</a>) The time limits for all rounds must be announced before the competition, and should not be changed after any affected rounds have begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
<li id="A1a4"><a href="#A1a4">A1a4</a>) The competitor must end each solve before the time limit for the attempt is reached. If a competitor's timer reaches the time limit for an attempt, the judge stops the solve immediately and records the result as DNF. Exception: 3x3x3 Multi-Blind (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>
<li id="A1a5"><a href="#A1a5">A1a5</a>) The time counting towards the time limit for an attempt is either the result after time penalties are applied (if the result was not DNF) or the time elapsed in the solve (if the result was DNF).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A1b"><a href="#A1b">A1b</a>) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
<ul>
<li id="A1b1"><a href="#A1b1">A1b1</a>) A Stackmat must be used in addition to the stopwatch. Exception: for events without inspection where the competitor is expected to exceed 10 minutes, use of the Stackmat is optional.</li>
<li id="A1b2"><a href="#A1b2">A1b2</a>) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise (e.g. the Stackmat timer malfunctioned, ran for over 10 minutes or was not used at all), the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A1c"><a href="#A1c">A1c</a>) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (see <a href="./#2k6">Regulation 2k6</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2"><a href="#A2">A2</a>) Scrambling:
<ul>
<li id="A2a"><a href="#A2a">A2a</a>) When called for a round, the competitor submits the puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler. The competitor then waits in their assigned Competitor Waiting Area until they are called to compete.</li>
<li id="A2b"><a href="#A2b">A2b</a>) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in <a href="./#4">Article 4</a>.
<ul>
<li id="A2b1"><a href="#A2b1">A2b1</a>) For Square-1, the organization team may enforce placing a thin object in the puzzle to prevent accidental moves from being applied before the start of the attempt. If these objects are used, the organization team should make an announcement before the round starts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2c"><a href="#A2c">A2c</a>) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
<ul>
<li id="A2c1"><a href="#A2c1">A2c1</a>) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the start of the attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2d"><a href="#A2d">A2d</a>) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.
<ul>
<li id="A2d1"><a href="#A2d1">A2d1</a>) The scrambler or an authorized judge must check the scrambled puzzle, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to affirm that they applied the correctly-numbered scramble sequence and checked that it matches the image (see <a href="./#4g">Regulation 4g</a>). Exception: for 6x6x6 Cube, 7x7x7 Cube, and Megaminx the scrambler may sign (or initial) to affirm that the puzzle is sufficiently scrambled (see <a href="./#4g1">Regulation 4g1</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2e"><a href="#A2e">A2e</a>) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring that it remains completely covered.
<ul>
<li id="A2e1"><a href="#A2e1">A2e1</a>) The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation, and the judge must not influence the orientation they place the puzzle on the mat based on what they know or expect the puzzle state to be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3"><a href="#A3">A3</a>) Inspection:
<ul>
<li id="A3a"><a href="#A3a">A3a</a>) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the start of each attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A3a1"><a href="#A3a1">A3a1</a>) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3b"><a href="#A3b">A3b</a>) The judge prepares the timer by turning it on and resetting if necessary. If a Generation 5 Pro Timer is in use, the judge must ensure it is set to 2-Pad mode. Separately, the judge also prepares a stopwatch for timing inspection.
<ul>
<li id="A3b1"><a href="#A3b1">A3b1</a>) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, the judge asks &quot;READY?&quot;. The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute from the moment they are asked, or else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A3b2"><a href="#A3b2">A3b2</a>) The competitor starts the attempt by confirming that they are ready, and the judge uncovers the puzzle and starts timing the inspection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3c"><a href="#A3c">A3c</a>) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
<ul>
<li id="A3c1"><a href="#A3c1">A3c1</a>) The competitor must not apply moves during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A3c2"><a href="#A3c2">A3c2</a>) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of <a href="./#10f">Regulation 10f</a>.</li>
<li id="A3c3"><a href="#A3c3">A3c3</a>) The competitor may reset the timer before the start of the solve.</li>
<li id="A3c4"><a href="#A3c4">A3c4</a>) For Square-1, if the use of a thin object inside the puzzle has been enforced by the organization team (see <a href="./#A2b1">Regulation A2b1</a>), the competitor may remove the object from the puzzle during inspection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3d"><a href="#A3d">A3d</a>) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation. Penalty for placing it outside the mat: time penalty (+2 seconds).
<ul>
<li id="A3d2"><a href="#A3d2">A3d2</a>) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;8 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
<li id="A3d3"><a href="#A3d3">A3d3</a>) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;12 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4"><a href="#A4">A4</a>) Starting the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A4b"><a href="#A4b">A4b</a>) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to the competitor. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
<ul>
<li id="A4b1"><a href="#A4b1">A4b1</a>) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle while starting the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4d"><a href="#A4d">A4d</a>) If a Stackmat timer is in use, the competitor should keep their hands on the timer until they see a green timer light. They start the solve by removing their hands from the timer (thus starting the timer).
<ul>
<li id="A4d1"><a href="#A4d1">A4d1</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A4d2"><a href="#A4d2">A4d2</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A4d3"><a href="#A4d3">A4d3</a>) If a stopwatch is in use, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4e"><a href="#A4e">A4e</a>) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A5"><a href="#A5">A5</a>) During the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A5a"><a href="#A5a">A5a</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge or the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A5b"><a href="#A5b">A5b</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface (also see <a href="./#2i">Regulation 2i</a>). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A5c"><a href="#A5c">A5c</a>) The competitor may hold the puzzle against the surface to help operate the puzzle (see <a href="./#7f1d">Regulation 7f1d</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6"><a href="#A6">A6</a>) Stopping the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A6a"><a href="#A6a">A6a</a>) The competitor releases the puzzle before stopping the solve, and stops the solve by stopping the timer. If a stopwatch is in use, the judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
<ul>
<li id="A6a1"><a href="#A6a1">A6a1</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that they have stopped the solve. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.</li>
<li id="A6a2"><a href="#A6a2">A6a2</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) from their hands and placing their hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the start of the attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6b"><a href="#A6b">A6b</a>) The competitor is responsible for stopping the Stackmat timer correctly.
<ul>
<li id="A6b1"><a href="#A6b1">A6b1</a>) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt is replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits the right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.</li>
<li id="A6b2"><a href="#A6b2">A6b2</a>) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt is disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, they may receive an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6c"><a href="#A6c">A6c</a>) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no moves have been applied after stopping the timer and before releasing the puzzle, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A6d"><a href="#A6d">A6d</a>) The competitor must stop the timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A6e"><a href="#A6e">A6e</a>) After stopping the timer, the competitor must not touch or apply a move to the puzzle until the judge has inspected the puzzle.
<ul>
<li id="A6e1"><a href="#A6e1">A6e1</a>) Penalty for applying a move to the puzzle after stopping the timer: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A6e2"><a href="#A6e2">A6e2</a>) Penalty for touching the puzzle after stopping the timer without applying any moves: time penalty (+2 seconds). Exception: if immediately after stopping the timer, the competitor briefly touches the puzzle without affecting its state, the time penalty may be lifted, at the discretion of the judge (see <a href="./#11f">Regulation 11f</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6f"><a href="#A6f">A6f</a>) The competitor must not reset the timer until both the competitor and the judge have signed the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
<ul>
<li id="A6f1"><a href="#A6f1">A6f1</a>) If the competitor resets the timer before the result has been completely recorded, the judge must not write down the result from memory or from video or photographic evidence, and must disqualify the attempt instead (DNF).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6g"><a href="#A6g">A6g</a>) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. They must not touch the puzzle before they have determined whether to assign a penalty for misalignment. Exception: For Clock, the judge will usually need to pick up the puzzle to verify both faces.</li>
<li id="A6h"><a href="#A6h">A6h</a>) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved.</li>
<li id="A6i"><a href="#A6i">A6i</a>) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7"><a href="#A7">A7</a>) Recording results:
<ul>
<li id="A7a"><a href="#A7a">A7a</a>) The judge tells the competitor the result.
<ul>
<li id="A7a1"><a href="#A7a1">A7a1</a>) If the judge finds that the puzzle is solved, they call &quot;OKAY&quot;.</li>
<li id="A7a2"><a href="#A7a2">A7a2</a>) If the judge assigns any penalties, they call &quot;PENALTY&quot;.</li>
<li id="A7a3"><a href="#A7a3">A7a3</a>) If the result is DNF, the judge calls &quot;DNF&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7b"><a href="#A7b">A7b</a>) The judge records the result on a score sheet and signs next to the result to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable.
<ul>
<li id="A7b1"><a href="#A7b1">A7b1</a>) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded time displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format should be &quot;X + T + Y = F&quot;, where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer (the &quot;original recorded time&quot;), Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65). If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7c"><a href="#A7c">A7c</a>) The competitor must check the recorded result, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable. This finishes the attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A7c1"><a href="#A7c1">A7c1</a>) If the competitor or the judge refuses to accept and sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute.</li>
<li id="A7c2"><a href="#A7c2">A7c2</a>) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt before they have begun it, they forfeit the attempt and the result will be considered DNS.</li>
<li id="A7c3"><a href="#A7c3">A7c3</a>) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt after starting the attempt but before the judge has finished recording the result, the attempt will be considered unfinished (DNF).</li>
<li id="A7c4"><a href="#A7c4">A7c4</a>) The competitor should not sign an attempt before the judge has recorded and signed the attempt. The competitor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that they and the judge have signed an attempt. If an attempt is found to be missing one or both signatures after the judge delivered the score sheet to the score taker (see <a href="./#A7f">Regulation A7f</a>), it will be considered unfinished (DNF).</li>
<li id="A7c5"><a href="#A7c5">A7c5</a>) Missing signatures found before the end of the competition may be added by the judge and/or the competitor, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7f"><a href="#A7f">A7f</a>) When a competitor's score sheet for a round is complete, the judge delivers the score sheet to the score taker.</li>
<li id="A7g"><a href="#A7g">A7g</a>) At the discretion of the WCA Delegate, an incident or penalty caused by a new competitor's inexperience may be replaced with an extra attempt.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li id="B2"><a href="#B2">B2</a>) Starting the attempt:
<ul>
<li id="B2a"><a href="#B2a">B2a</a>) The judge resets the timer(s) as in <a href="./#A3b">Regulation A3b</a> and indicates that they are ready for the competitor to start the attempt (e.g. placing the puzzle cover in front of the competitor, saying &quot;READY&quot;, giving a thumbs-up signal). The competitor must start the attempt within one minute, else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="B2b"><a href="#B2b">B2b</a>) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to them. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
