<li id="4b1+"><a href="#4b1+">4b1+</a>) <span class="REMINDER label linked"><a href="./#4b1">REMINDER</a></span> The WCA Delegate must never re-generate any scramble sequences to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not permitted to glance at the scramble sequences for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate &quot;fairer&quot; scramble sequences.</li>
<li id="4b2+"><a href="#4b2+">4b2+</a>) <span class="CLARIFICATION label linked"><a href="./#4b2">CLARIFICATION</a></span> In general, all official scramble sequences should be kept secret during the competition and published together after the end of the competition.

<li id="4b2++"><a href="#4b2++">4b2++</a>) <span class="ADDITION label linked"><a href="./#4b2">ADDITION</a></span> Competition organizers should ensure that scramblers, scramble sequences, and partially/fully scrambled puzzles are visually isolated from competitors (see <a href="./#A2c">Regulation A2c</a>). For example, the scramblers may be located behind a wall, or a sufficiently high divider (e.g. a cardboard divider placed around the sides of a table where the scramblers are seated) may be used so that competitors are not able to see puzzles as the scramblers apply scramble sequences.</li>

<li id="4d+"><a href="#4d+">4d+</a>) <span class="CLARIFICATION label linked"><a href="./#4d">CLARIFICATION</a></span> Some puzzles use standard color schemes, except that white is replaced with black. In this case, black is the darkest color and must not be treated as white.</li>
<li id="4d++"><a href="#4d++">4d++</a>) <span class="ADDITION label linked"><a href="./#4d">ADDITION</a></span> It is permitted for the puzzle to change its orientation when it is moved from the scrambler to the solving station, as long as no one is attempting to influence the randomness of the orientation (see <a href="./#A2e1">Regulation A2e1</a>).</li>
<li id="4f+"><a href="#4f+">4f+</a>) <span class="RECOMMENDATION label linked"><a href="./#4f">RECOMMENDATION</a></span> The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scramble sequences for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scramble sequences for extra attempts.</li>

Examples of intentionally causing puzzle defects: removing an attached center cap, rotating a corner piece, peeling a sticker.</li>

For this particular example, note that only the final result for an attempt counts. Therefore, a third attempt with an original recorded time of 13:59 without penalties meets the time limit because the final result is 13:59 (see <a href="./#9f2">Regulation 9f2</a>), while a third attempt with a result of 13:59 + 2 = 14:01 does not meet the time limit.</li>

If the competitor accidentally tries to start the solve with a timer that the judge did not reset (i.e. the competitor performs inspection, places hands on the timer for a reasonable length of time, assumes that the timer will start normally, and starts to operate the puzzle), the attempt should be replaced by an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
