<li id="4b3a"><a href="#4b3a">4b3a</a>) For blindfolded events, the scramble sequence must orient the puzzle randomly (equal probability for each orientation).</li>
<li id="4b3b"><a href="#4b3b">4b3b</a>) 2x2x2 Cube: The (random) state must require at least 4 moves to solve.</li>
<li id="4b3c"><a href="#4b3c">4b3c</a>) Skewb: The (random) state must require at least 7 moves to solve.</li>
<li id="4b3d"><a href="#4b3d">4b3d</a>) Square-1: The (random) state must require at least 11 moves to solve.</li>
<li id="4b3e"><a href="#4b3e">4b3e</a>) 5x5x5 Cube, 6x6x6 Cube, 7x7x7 Cube, and Megaminx: sufficiently many random moves (instead of random state), at least 2 moves to solve.</li>
<li id="4b3f"><a href="#4b3f">4b3f</a>) Pyraminx: The (random) state must require at least 6 moves to solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="4b4"><a href="#4b4">4b4</a>) Each scramble sequence should be applied during a maximum time frame of 2 hours. This time frame starts when the scramble sequence is applied for the first time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="4d"><a href="#4d">4d</a>) Scrambling orientation:
<ul>
<li id="4d1"><a href="#4d1">4d1</a>) NxNxN Cubes and Megaminx are scrambled starting with the white face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on the top and the darkest adjacent green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.</li>
<li id="4d2"><a href="#4d2">4d2</a>) Pyraminx is scrambled starting with the yellow face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on the bottom and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front.</li>
<li id="4d3"><a href="#4d3">4d3</a>) Square-1 is scrambled starting with the darker color on front (out of the 2 possible scrambling orientations).</li>
<li id="4d4"><a href="#4d4">4d4</a>) Clock is scrambled starting with either side in front and 12 o'clock pointing up.</li>
<li id="4d5"><a href="#4d5">4d5</a>) Skewb is scrambled starting with the white face (if not possible, then the lightest face) on top and the green face (if not possible, then the darkest adjacent face) on the front-left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="4f"><a href="#4f">4f</a>) Competition scramble sequences must be generated using a current official version of an official WCA scramble program (available <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/">via the WCA website</a>).</li>
<li id="4g"><a href="#4g">4g</a>) After scrambling a puzzle, the scrambler must verify that the puzzle is scrambled correctly. If the puzzle state is wrong, the scrambler must correct it (e.g. by solving the puzzle and applying the scramble sequence again).
<ul>
<li id="4g1"><a href="#4g1">4g1</a>) Exception: For the 6x6x6 Cube, 7x7x7 Cube, and Megaminx, it is not necessary to correct the puzzle state, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
<li id="4g2"><a href="#4g2">4g2</a>) Exception: For Clock, if the state of the pins is affected during transportation or uncovering, the pins may be left uncorrected.</li>

<ul>
<li id="5a"><a href="#5a">5a</a>) Examples of puzzle defects include: popped parts, pieces twisted in place, and detached screws/caps/stickers.</li>
<li id="5b"><a href="#5b">5b</a>) If a puzzle defect occurs during an attempt, the competitor may choose to either repair the defect and continue the attempt, or to stop the attempt.
<ul>
<li id="5b1"><a href="#5b1">5b1</a>) If a competitor chooses to repair the puzzle, they must repair only the defective parts. Tools and/or parts of other puzzles must not be used to repair the original puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="5b2"><a href="#5b2">5b2</a>) Any repair to a puzzle must not give the competitor an advantage in solving the puzzle. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="5b3"><a href="#5b3">5b3</a>) Permitted repairs:
<ul>
<li id="5b3a"><a href="#5b3a">5b3a</a>) If any parts have fallen out or moved out of place, the competitor may place them back.</li>
<li id="5b3b"><a href="#5b3b">5b3b</a>) If the competitor repairs the puzzle but finds that the puzzle is unsolvable later during the solve, they may disassemble and reassemble a maximum of 4 pieces to make the puzzle solvable.</li>
<li id="5b3c"><a href="#5b3c">5b3c</a>) If the puzzle is unsolvable, and can be made solvable by rotating a single corner piece, the competitor may correct the corner piece by twisting it in place without disassembling the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="5b4"><a href="#5b4">5b4</a>) During a blindfolded phase (see <a href="./#B4">Regulation B4</a>), all repairs must be performed blindfolded. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="5b5"><a href="#5b5">5b5</a>) If some parts of the puzzle are physically detached or not fully placed at the end of the solve, the following regulations apply:
<ul>
<li id="5b5a"><a href="#5b5a">5b5a</a>) If one or more parts without colored faces are affected, the puzzle is considered solved.</li>
<li id="5b5b"><a href="#5b5b">5b5b</a>) If one part with one colored face is affected, the puzzle is considered solved.</li>
<li id="5b5c"><a href="#5b5c">5b5c</a>) If more than one part with one colored face is affected, the puzzle is considered unsolved (DNF).</li>
<li id="5b5d"><a href="#5b5d">5b5d</a>) If one or more parts with more than one colored face are affected, the puzzle is considered unsolved (DNF).</li>
<li id="5b5e"><a href="#5b5e">5b5e</a>) Regulations <a href="./#5b5c">5b5c</a> and <a href="./#5b5d">5b5d</a> supersede <a href="./#5b5a">5b5a</a> and <a href="./#5b5b">5b5b</a>.</li>
<li id="5b5f"><a href="#5b5f">5b5f</a>) If a piece is partially detached or not fully placed, its final position is the closest position in which the affected piece would normally fit within the puzzle mechanism, considering the current state of the puzzle. If the final position renders the piece solved, the piece is not considered to be affected by the puzzle defect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="5b6"><a href="#5b6">5b6</a>) Definition: A part is one or more fully connected components from a group of puzzle components that remain connected and do not move relative to each other during ordinary operation of the puzzle (e.g. a 3x3x3 center cap, a Pyraminx tip, a 3x3x3 corner piece missing one face, one face of a 3x3x3 corner piece).</li>

<li id="9f"><a href="#9f">9f</a>) The results of a round are measured as follows:
<ul>
<li id="9f1"><a href="#9f1">9f1</a>) All timed results under 10 minutes, except for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, are measured and truncated down to hundredths of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.</li>
<li id="9f2"><a href="#9f2">9f2</a>) All timed results, averages, and means over 10 minutes, as well as all times for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind results, are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. X.49 becomes X, X.50 becomes X+1).</li>
<li id="9f4"><a href="#9f4">9f4</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNF (Did Not Finish) if the attempt is disqualified or unsolved/unfinished.
<ul>
<li id="9f4a"><a href="#9f4a">9f4a</a>) If a competitor violates a regulation clearly enough that the attempt is certain to be disqualified, the judge should immediately stop the attempt. If the judge is uncertain or a dispute could be disruptive (e.g. because an extra attempt could delay the competition), the judge should consult the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9f5"><a href="#9f5">9f5</a>) The result of an attempt is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start) if the competitor is eligible for an attempt but declines it.</li>
<li id="9f6"><a href="#9f6">9f6</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, each competitor is allotted X attempts. The best result of these attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f7"><a href="#9f7">9f7</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, a DNF or DNS is the worst possible result.</li>
<li id="9f8"><a href="#9f8">9f8</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 5 attempts. Of these 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f9"><a href="#9f9">9f9</a>) For &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, one DNF or DNS is permitted to count as the competitor's worst result of the round. If a competitor has more than one DNF and/or DNS result in the round, their average result for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f10"><a href="#9f10">9f10</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, competitors are allotted 3 attempts. The arithmetic mean of the 3 attempts determines the competitor's ranking in the round.</li>
<li id="9f11"><a href="#9f11">9f11</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; rounds, if the competitor has at least one DNF or DNS result, their average result for the round is DNF.</li>
<li id="9f12"><a href="#9f12">9f12</a>) For &quot;Best of X&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the best result per competitor. The following are used to compare results:
<ul>
<li id="9f12a"><a href="#9f12a">9f12a</a>) For timed results, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter time.</li>
<li id="9f12b"><a href="#9f12b">9f12b</a>) For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, &quot;better&quot; is defined as the shorter solution length.</li>
<li id="9f12c"><a href="#9f12c">9f12c</a>) For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles solved minus the number of puzzles not solved, where a greater difference is better. If the difference is less than 0, or if only 1 puzzle is solved, the attempt is considered unsolved (DNF). If competitors achieve the same result, rankings are assessed based on total time, where the shorter recorded time is better. If competitors achieve the same result and the same time, rankings are assessed based on the number of puzzles the competitors failed to solve, where fewer unsolved puzzles are better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9f13"><a href="#9f13">9f13</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, rankings are assessed based on the ordering of the averages/means of the competitors, where &quot;better&quot; is the smaller recorded result.</li>
<li id="9f14"><a href="#9f14">9f14</a>) For &quot;Mean of 3&quot; and &quot;Average of 5&quot; rounds, if two or more competitors achieve identical average/mean results, rankings are assessed based on the best attempt per competitor, where &quot;better&quot; is defined as the smaller recorded result.</li>
<li id="9f15"><a href="#9f15">9f15</a>) Competitors who achieve the same result in a round receive an identical ranking for the round.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="9g"><a href="#9g">9g</a>) A Cutoff Round is a round with a &quot;Best of X&quot; cutoff phase and a cutoff requirement (e.g. &quot;Best of 2&quot; with a cutoff requirement of strictly better than 2 minutes). If the competitor satisfies the cutoff requirement in at least one of their cutoff phase attempts, they are eligible for the remaining attempts. Attempts from the cutoff phase count towards the full round format.</li>
<li id="9i"><a href="#9i">9i</a>) Results of official WCA competitions must be listed on the WCA world rankings.
<ul>
<li id="9i1"><a href="#9i1">9i1</a>) The WCA recognizes the following types of regional records: national records, continental records, and world records.</li>
<li id="9i2"><a href="#9i2">9i2</a>) All the results of a round are considered to take place on the last calendar date of the round. If a regional record is broken multiple times on the same calendar date, only the best result is recognized as breaking that regional record.</li>
<li id="9i3"><a href="#9i3">9i3</a>) If the WCA Regulations for an event are changed, existing regional records stand until they are broken under the new WCA Regulations.</li>

<ul>
<li id="9p1"><a href="#9p1">9p1</a>) At least 25% of competitors must be eliminated between consecutive rounds of the same event.</li>
<li id="9p2"><a href="#9p2">9p2</a>) The competitors who advance to the next round must be determined by ranking (best X competitors) or by result (all competitors with a better result than X) in the preceding round.
<ul>
<li id="9p2a"><a href="#9p2a">9p2a</a>) For each round, advancement conditions must be announced before the round starts, and should not be changed after it has begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
</ul>

<li id="11d"><a href="#11d">11d</a>) If the WCA Regulations are not fully clear or if the incident is not covered by the WCA Regulations, then the WCA Delegate must make a decision based on fair sportsmanship (also see <a href="./#11e3">Regulation 11e3</a>).</li>
<li id="11e"><a href="#11e">11e</a>) The WCA Delegate may grant a competitor an extra attempt to replace an attempt affected by an incident. The competitor should appeal verbally or in writing to the judge and WCA Delegate at the time of the incident, before finishing the original attempt, to be eligible for an extra attempt. An appeal does not guarantee the competitor an extra attempt.
<ul>
<li id="11e1"><a href="#11e1">11e1</a>) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt must be scrambled using a different scramble sequence. This scramble sequence must be generated using a current official version of an official WCA scramble program (see <a href="./#4f">Regulation 4f</a>).</li>
<li id="11e2"><a href="#11e2">11e2</a>) If a competitor is granted an extra attempt, the extra attempt should be done right after the attempt that caused it, and must replace the original regularly numbered attempt.</li>
<li id="11e3"><a href="#11e3">11e3</a>) If it is unclear whether an incident should result in an extra attempt, the competitor may be granted a provisional extra attempt that will be used only if it is later found that an extra attempt was appropriate (e.g. by a decision of the WRC).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="11f"><a href="#11f">11f</a>) Decisions about an incident may be supported with video or photographic analysis, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
<li id="11g"><a href="#11g">11g</a>) The WCA Delegate must ensure that copies of the Regulations and Guidelines are available (e.g. printed, digital, or accessible via internet) to officials and competitors for consultation on any incidents.</li>
<li id="11h"><a href="#11h">11h</a>) A WCA Delegate may require competitors in serious violation of <a href="./#2k3">Regulation 2k3</a> to leave the competition venue, taking into account the seriousness of the situation and the best possible course of action. If the competitor refuses to do so, they may face disciplinary action in the WCA.</li>

</ul>
<div id="A"><div id="speedsolving"><h2 id="article-A-speedsolving"> <a href="#article-A-speedsolving">Article A</a>: Speed Solving</h2></div></div>

<ul>
<li id="A1"><a href="#A1">A1</a>) Speed Solving attempts must abide by the following procedures.
<ul>
<li id="A1a"><a href="#A1a">A1a</a>) The organization team must apply at least one kind of time limit (time limit per attempt and/or cumulative time limit) to each round.
<ul>
<li id="A1a1"><a href="#A1a1">A1a1</a>) The default time limit is 10 minutes for each attempt in a round, though the organization team may announce a higher or lower time limit per attempt. In this case, the limit must be the same for all attempts in a round.</li>
<li id="A1a2"><a href="#A1a2">A1a2</a>) For events other than 3x3x3 Fewest Moves and 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, the organization team may define a cumulative time limit. The cumulative time limit must either apply to all attempts in one round (e.g. 3 attempts with a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes), or to all attempts in a combination of rounds for different events. In this case, the time limit for a particular attempt is the time limit or the cumulative time limit minus the total time in other attempts counting towards the time limit so far (see <a href="./#A1a5">Regulation A1a5</a>), whichever is lower. If a round has an applicable cumulative time limit, it must have at most one.</li>
<li id="A1a3"><a href="#A1a3">A1a3</a>) The time limits for all rounds must be announced before the competition, and should not be changed after any affected rounds have begun. Changes must be made at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, who must carefully consider the fairness of the change.</li>
<li id="A1a4"><a href="#A1a4">A1a4</a>) The competitor must end each solve before the time limit for the attempt is reached. If a competitor's timer reaches the time limit for an attempt, the judge stops the solve immediately and records the result as DNF. Exception: 3x3x3 Multi-Blind (see <a href="./#H1b1">Regulation H1b1</a>).</li>
<li id="A1a5"><a href="#A1a5">A1a5</a>) The time counting towards the time limit for an attempt is either the result after time penalties are applied (if the result was not DNF) or the time elapsed in the solve (if the result was DNF).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A1b"><a href="#A1b">A1b</a>) If the time limit for an attempt is greater than 10 minutes, a stopwatch must be used for timekeeping.
<ul>
<li id="A1b1"><a href="#A1b1">A1b1</a>) A Stackmat must be used in addition to the stopwatch. Exception: for events without inspection where the competitor is expected to exceed 10 minutes, use of the Stackmat is optional.</li>
<li id="A1b2"><a href="#A1b2">A1b2</a>) If a time from the Stackmat timer is available, it is the original recorded time. Otherwise (e.g. the Stackmat timer malfunctioned, ran for over 10 minutes or was not used at all), the stopwatch time is the original recorded time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A1c"><a href="#A1c">A1c</a>) A competitor participating in an event must be able to fulfill the event's requirements (see <a href="./#2k6">Regulation 2k6</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2"><a href="#A2">A2</a>) Scrambling:
<ul>
<li id="A2a"><a href="#A2a">A2a</a>) When called for a round, the competitor submits the puzzle, in its solved state, to the scrambler. The competitor then waits in their assigned Competitor Waiting Area until they are called to compete.</li>
<li id="A2b"><a href="#A2b">A2b</a>) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations in <a href="./#4">Article 4</a>.
<ul>
<li id="A2b1"><a href="#A2b1">A2b1</a>) For Square-1, the organization team may enforce placing a thin object in the puzzle to prevent accidental moves from being applied before the start of the attempt. If these objects are used, the organization team should make an announcement before the round starts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2c"><a href="#A2c">A2c</a>) After the scrambler starts scrambling the puzzle, the competitor must not see the puzzle until the inspection phase starts.
<ul>
<li id="A2c1"><a href="#A2c1">A2c1</a>) The scrambler places a cover over the scrambled puzzle that makes it impossible for any competitors or spectators to see any part of the puzzle. The cover remains over the puzzle until the start of the attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2d"><a href="#A2d">A2d</a>) When taking a puzzle from the scrambler, the judge briefly inspects the puzzle to ensure thorough scrambling of the puzzle. The judge raises any concerns with the scrambler, who then conducts a detailed check.
<ul>
<li id="A2d1"><a href="#A2d1">A2d1</a>) The scrambler or an authorized judge must check the scrambled puzzle, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to affirm that they applied the correctly-numbered scramble sequence and checked that it matches the image (see <a href="./#4g">Regulation 4g</a>). Exception: for 6x6x6 Cube, 7x7x7 Cube, and Megaminx the scrambler may sign (or initial) to affirm that the puzzle is sufficiently scrambled (see <a href="./#4g1">Regulation 4g1</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A2e"><a href="#A2e">A2e</a>) The judge places the puzzle onto the mat in an arbitrary orientation while ensuring that it remains completely covered.
<ul>
<li id="A2e1"><a href="#A2e1">A2e1</a>) The competitor is not permitted to request a specific orientation, and the judge must not influence the orientation they place the puzzle on the mat based on what they know or expect the puzzle state to be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3"><a href="#A3">A3</a>) Inspection:
<ul>
<li id="A3a"><a href="#A3a">A3a</a>) The competitor may inspect the puzzle at the start of each attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A3a1"><a href="#A3a1">A3a1</a>) The competitor is allotted a maximum of 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle and start the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3b"><a href="#A3b">A3b</a>) The judge prepares the timer by turning it on and resetting if necessary. If a Generation 5 Pro Timer is in use, the judge must ensure it is set to 2-Pad mode. Separately, the judge also prepares a stopwatch for timing inspection.
<ul>
<li id="A3b1"><a href="#A3b1">A3b1</a>) When the judge believes the competitor is ready, the judge asks &quot;READY?&quot;. The competitor must be ready to start the attempt within one minute from the moment they are asked, or else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A3b2"><a href="#A3b2">A3b2</a>) The competitor starts the attempt by confirming that they are ready, and the judge uncovers the puzzle and starts timing the inspection.</li>
<li id="A3b3"><a href="#A3b3">A3b3</a>) When 8 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;8 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
<li id="A3b4"><a href="#A3b4">A3b4</a>) When 12 seconds of inspection have elapsed, the judge calls &quot;12 SECONDS&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3c"><a href="#A3c">A3c</a>) The competitor may pick up the puzzle during inspection.
<ul>
<li id="A3c1"><a href="#A3c1">A3c1</a>) The competitor must not apply moves or intentional changes in alignment during inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: see <a href="./#A3c2">Regulation A3c2</a> and <a href="./#A3c5">Regulation A3c5</a>.</li>
<li id="A3c2"><a href="#A3c2">A3c2</a>) If the parts of the puzzle are not fully aligned when the cover is removed, then the competitor may align the faces, as long as misalignments stay within the limits of <a href="./#10f">Regulation 10f</a>.</li>
<li id="A3c3"><a href="#A3c3">A3c3</a>) The competitor may reset the timer before the start of the solve.</li>
<li id="A3c4"><a href="#A3c4">A3c4</a>) For Square-1, if the use of a thin object inside the puzzle has been enforced by the organization team (see <a href="./#A2b1">Regulation A2b1</a>), the competitor may remove the object from the puzzle during inspection.</li>
<li id="A3c5"><a href="#A3c5">A3c5</a>) For Square-1, the competitor should not be penalized for any accidental move made within the limits of <a href="./#10f">Regulation 10f</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A3d"><a href="#A3d">A3d</a>) At the end of the inspection, the competitor places the puzzle on the mat, in any orientation. Penalty for placing it outside the mat: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4"><a href="#A4">A4</a>) Starting the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A4b"><a href="#A4b">A4b</a>) The competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the Stackmat timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to the competitor. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).
<ul>
<li id="A4b1"><a href="#A4b1">A4b1</a>) The competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle while starting the solve. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4d"><a href="#A4d">A4d</a>) If a Stackmat timer is in use, the competitor should keep their hands on the timer until they see a green timer light. They start the solve by removing their hands from the timer (thus starting the timer).
<ul>
<li id="A4d1"><a href="#A4d1">A4d1</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 15 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A4d2"><a href="#A4d2">A4d2</a>) The competitor must start the solve within 17 seconds of the start of the inspection. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A4d3"><a href="#A4d3">A4d3</a>) If a stopwatch is in use, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A4e"><a href="#A4e">A4e</a>) Time penalties for starting the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A5"><a href="#A5">A5</a>) During the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A5a"><a href="#A5a">A5a</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not communicate with anyone other than the judge or the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If the competitor does not gain an advantage by communicating with anyone other than the judge or the WCA Delegate, the result may stand, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
<li id="A5b"><a href="#A5b">A5b</a>) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not receive assistance from anyone or any object other than the surface (also see <a href="./#2i">Regulation 2i</a>). Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A5c"><a href="#A5c">A5c</a>) The competitor may hold the puzzle against the surface to help operate the puzzle (see <a href="./#7f1d">Regulation 7f1d</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6"><a href="#A6">A6</a>) Stopping the solve:
<ul>
<li id="A6a"><a href="#A6a">A6a</a>) The competitor releases the puzzle before stopping the solve, and stops the solve by stopping the timer. If a stopwatch is in use, the judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.</li>
<li id="A6b"><a href="#A6b">A6b</a>) The competitor is responsible for stopping the Stackmat timer correctly.
<ul>
<li id="A6b1"><a href="#A6b1">A6b1</a>) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and the timer shows a time strictly below 0.06 seconds, then the attempt is replaced by an extra attempt. A competitor forfeits the right to the additional attempt if the WCA Delegate determines that the timer was stopped deliberately.</li>
<li id="A6b2"><a href="#A6b2">A6b2</a>) If the timer stops before the competitor has solved the puzzle and displays a time of 0.06 seconds or higher, then the attempt is disqualified (DNF). Exception: if the competitor can demonstrate that the timer malfunctioned, they may receive an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6c"><a href="#A6c">A6c</a>) The competitor must fully release the puzzle before stopping the timer. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF). Exception: If no move or any change in alignment has been applied after stopping the timer and before releasing the puzzle, a time penalty (+2 seconds) may be assigned instead, at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="A6d"><a href="#A6d">A6d</a>) The competitor must stop the Stackmat timer using both hands, placed flat on the sensors with palms down. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="A6e"><a href="#A6e">A6e</a>) After stopping the timer, the competitor must not touch, apply a move, or make any change in alignment to the puzzle, until the judge has inspected the puzzle.
<ul>
<li id="A6e1"><a href="#A6e1">A6e1</a>) Penalty for applying a move to the puzzle after stopping the timer: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="A6e2"><a href="#A6e2">A6e2</a>) Penalty for touching the puzzle after stopping the timer without applying any moves: time penalty (+2 seconds). Exception: if immediately after stopping the timer, the competitor briefly touches the puzzle without affecting its state, the time penalty may be lifted, at the discretion of the judge (see <a href="./#11f">Regulation 11f</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6f"><a href="#A6f">A6f</a>) The competitor must not reset the timer until both the competitor and the judge have signed the score sheet. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF), at the discretion of the judge.
<ul>
<li id="A6f1"><a href="#A6f1">A6f1</a>) If the competitor resets the timer before the result has been completely recorded, the judge must not write down the result from memory or from video or photographic evidence, and must disqualify the attempt instead (DNF).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A6g"><a href="#A6g">A6g</a>) The judge determines whether the puzzle is solved. If the puzzle is misaligned, it must not be touched before the judge has determined its final state.</li>
<li id="A6h"><a href="#A6h">A6h</a>) In case of a dispute, moves or alignments must not be applied to the puzzle before the dispute is resolved.</li>
<li id="A6i"><a href="#A6i">A6i</a>) Time penalties for stopping the solve are cumulative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7"><a href="#A7">A7</a>) Recording results:
<ul>
<li id="A7a"><a href="#A7a">A7a</a>) The judge tells the competitor the result.
<ul>
<li id="A7a1"><a href="#A7a1">A7a1</a>) The judge should indicate to the competitor that the puzzle is solved, or that a penalty will be applied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7b"><a href="#A7b">A7b</a>) The judge records the result on a score sheet and signs next to the result to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable.
<ul>
<li id="A7b1"><a href="#A7b1">A7b1</a>) If penalties are assigned, the judge records the original recorded time displayed on the timer, along with any penalties. The format should be &quot;X + T + Y = F&quot;, where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer (the &quot;original recorded time&quot;), Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65). If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="A7c"><a href="#A7c">A7c</a>) The competitor must check the recorded result, and sign (or initial) the score sheet to acknowledge that the result is correct, complete, properly formatted, and clearly readable. This finishes the attempt.
<ul>
<li id="A7c1"><a href="#A7c1">A7c1</a>) If the competitor or the judge refuses to accept and sign the score sheet, the WCA Delegate must resolve the dispute.</li>
<li id="A7c2"><a href="#A7c2">A7c2</a>) If the competitor intentionally signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt before they have begun it, they forfeit the attempt and the result will be considered DNS.</li>
<li id="A7c3"><a href="#A7c3">A7c3</a>) If the competitor signs (or otherwise marks) an attempt after starting the attempt but before the judge has finished recording the result, the attempt will be considered unfinished (DNF).</li>
<li id="A7c4"><a href="#A7c4">A7c4</a>) The competitor should not sign an attempt before the judge has recorded and signed the attempt. The competitor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that they and the judge have signed an attempt. If an attempt is found to be missing one or both signatures after the judge delivered the score sheet to the score taker (see <a href="./#A7f">Regulation A7f</a>), it will be considered unfinished (DNF).</li>
<li id="A7c5"><a href="#A7c5">A7c5</a>) Missing signatures found before the end of the competition (see <a href="./#9u">Regulation 9u</a>) may be added by the judge and/or the competitor, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.</li>

<ul>
<li id="B1"><a href="#B1">B1</a>) Standard speed solving procedures are followed, as described in <a href="./#A">Article A</a> (Speed Solving). Additional regulations that supersede the corresponding procedures in <a href="./#A">Article A</a> are described below.
<ul>
<li id="B1a"><a href="#B1a">B1a</a>) There is no inspection period (i.e. the solve starts at the same time as the attempt).</li>
<li id="B1b"><a href="#B1b">B1b</a>) The competitor supplies their own blindfold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="B2"><a href="#B2">B2</a>) Starting the attempt:
<ul>
<li id="B2a"><a href="#B2a">B2a</a>) The judge resets the timer(s) as in <a href="./#A3b">Regulation A3b</a> and indicates that they are ready for the competitor to start the attempt (e.g. placing the puzzle cover in front of the competitor, saying &quot;READY&quot;, giving a thumbs-up signal). The competitor must start the attempt within one minute, else the competitor forfeits the attempt (DNS), at the discretion of the judge.</li>
<li id="B2b"><a href="#B2b">B2b</a>) When using the Stackmat timer, the competitor uses their fingers to touch the elevated sensor surfaces of the timer. The competitor's palms must be facing down, and located on the side of the timer that is closer to them. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="B2c"><a href="#B2c">B2c</a>) When using the Stackmat timer, the competitor must have no physical contact with the puzzle or the puzzle cover while starting the attempt. Penalty: time penalty (+2 seconds).</li>
<li id="B2d"><a href="#B2d">B2d</a>) When using the Stackmat timer, the competitor starts the attempt by removing their hands from the timer, thus starting the timer. (This also starts the solve.)
<ul>
<li id="B2d1"><a href="#B2d1">B2d1</a>) The competitor removes the cover from the puzzle after starting the timer.</li>
<li id="B2d2"><a href="#B2d2">B2d2</a>) If a stopwatch is in use in addition to the Stackmat timer, the judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="B2f"><a href="#B2f">B2f</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor confirms they are ready and starts the solve by lifting the cover. The judge starts the stopwatch as soon as the competitor starts the solve.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li id="B4"><a href="#B4">B4</a>) Blindfolded phase:
<ul>
<li id="B4a"><a href="#B4a">B4a</a>) The competitor dons the blindfold to start the blindfolded phase.
<ul>
<li id="B4a1"><a href="#B4a1">B4a1</a>) Until the competitor applies the first move to the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold to return to the memorization phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="B4b"><a href="#B4b">B4b</a>) The competitor must not apply moves or intentional changes in alignment to the puzzle before they have fully donned the blindfold. Penalty: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
<li id="B4c"><a href="#B4c">B4c</a>) As soon as the competitor applies the first move to the puzzle, the judge must ensure that there is a sight blocker (e.g. a sheet of paper or cardboard) between the competitor's face and the puzzle.
<ul>
<li id="B4c1"><a href="#B4c1">B4c1</a>) In all cases, the competitor must wear the blindfold such that their view of the puzzle would still clearly be blocked if the sight blocker were not in the way.</li>
<li id="B4c3"><a href="#B4c3">B4c3</a>) If the judge and competitor agree beforehand, the competitor may choose to place the puzzle behind a suitable object (e.g. a music stand, the surface of the table) by themselves during the blindfolded phase.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li id="B5a1"><a href="#B5a1">B5a1</a>) If a stopwatch is in use in addition to the Stackmat timer, the judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor stops the solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="B5b"><a href="#B5b">B5b</a>) When using a stopwatch as the only timer, the competitor stops the solve by releasing the puzzle and notifying the judge that they have stopped the solve. The judge stops the stopwatch as soon as the competitor does this.
<ul>
<li id="B5b1"><a href="#B5b1">B5b1</a>) The competitor's default notification signal consists of releasing the puzzle(s) from their hands and placing their hands on the surface, with palms down. The competitor and the judge may agree on another appropriate notification before the start of the attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="B5c"><a href="#B5c">B5c</a>) If the competitor is not touching the puzzle, they may remove the blindfold before they stop the timer. They must not touch the puzzle until the end of the solve. Penalty for touching the puzzle: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).</li>
